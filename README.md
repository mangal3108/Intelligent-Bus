### 🚌 Intelligent Bus Passenger Counter with Buzzer Alert 🚨

This Arduino-based project is designed to **automatically count passengers entering and exiting a bus** using **IR sensors** and display the live count on a **16x2 LCD screen**. It also includes a **buzzer alert system** that activates when the number of passengers exceeds a predefined safety limit (e.g., 30 passengers), ensuring real-time capacity monitoring for public transport vehicles.
